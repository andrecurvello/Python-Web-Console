Like TryPython, except with the ability to publish and share scripts.
Inspired by the Groovy Web Console, which also runs on AppEngine.  Ironically 
enough, the application itself is written in Java and utilizes Jython, as 
CPython cannot be safely sandboxed.

Instructions:

 ./download-static-files.sh  # download external files from other projects 

 mvn gae:unpack              # download the appengine SDK
 mvn compile gae:run         # run a development server
