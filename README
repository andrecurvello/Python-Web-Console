Like TryPython, except with the ability to publish and share scripts.
Inspired by the Groovy Web Console, which also runs on AppEngine.  Ironically 
enough, the application itself is written in Java and utilizes Jython, as 
CPython cannot be safely sandboxed.

Instructions:

 ./download-static-files.sh  # download external files from other projects 
 mvn minify:minify -Pminify-syntax    # minify syntaxhighlighter sources
 mvn minify:minify -Pminify-ojay      # minify ojay sources
 
 mvn gae:unpack              # download the appengine SDK
 mvn compile gae:run         # run a development server


TODO
 * Atom comment feed
 * Admin delete feature for scripts and comments
 * Syntax hilighting for editor
 * Login for editing/deleting/modifying published scripts
 * Twitter & Facebook 'share' buttons
