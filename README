Like TryPython, except with the ability to publish and share scripts.
Inspired by the Groovy Web Console, which also runs on AppEngine.  Ironically 
enough, the application itself is written in Java and utilizes Jython, as 
CPython cannot be safely sandboxed.

Instructions:

 ./download-static-files.sh  # download external files from other projects 

 mvn gae:unpack              # download the appengine SDK
 mvn compile gae:run         # run a development server


TODO
 * Comments + atom comment feed
 ** Captcha for commenting anonymously
 * Scaled labels for tag cloud
 * Admin delete feature for scripts and comments
 * Google & Bing sitemap ping when new script is posted (as async job)
 * Syntax hilighting for editor
 * Login for editing/deleting/modifying published scripts
